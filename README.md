# lab5 Blog Server

Most of this went very smoothly, almost all snags were merely figuring out specific syntax. The only real roadblock I ran into was sorting by created_at as I couldn't figure out how to get mongoose timestamps to work. Instead just initialized a new Date object when a Post was created. Wish I had had more time to pursue some of the extra credit.

Part two went well. Spent a good amount of time trying to figure out how to get username to work, but it eventually worked. Authentication was totally fine. Using the libraries like passport and bcrypt made it pretty easy to follow I thought.
